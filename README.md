# morse
A set of stuffs I made for morse code. Don't ask why.  
encode.java converts from latin to written morse. It does not support lowecase letters, or any puncutaion besides `,` and `.`  
decode.java is vise-versa encode.java. same limitations apply.  
learner.java is a tool made to help people wanting to learn morse. It teaches the basic ABC-XYZ, 0-9, `,` and `.` .
